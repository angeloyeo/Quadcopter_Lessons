# Quadcopter_Lessons

# Introduction

Welcome to the MATLAB lesson on the UAV Airframe Model.   This lesson is prepared by California State University and MathWorks and is designed to help students understand and construct a simple UAV airframe model.   The MATLAB LiveScript lesson is the first of a four part series about UAV models:

Airframe Model - You will be introduced to how to model the physics of flight

Quadcopter Model - You will learn how to model the features of a quadcopter which distinguish it from other aircraft

Quadcopter Control - You will be introduced to closed-loop control and how it can be implemented on a quadcopter

PID Tuning - You will learn to use some of the tools to help you achieve the control performance you need

Each of these lessons will contain a set of MATLAB LiveScript modules followed by a video lesson developing the corresponding part of a Simulink model.   In the end, you will be able to assemble a Simulink model of a UAV of your own and will have an appreciation of the underlying physics and numerical calculations that compose the model.

# Videos
There are accompanying videos for each of the LiveScript lessons.

There are Simulink files accompanying each of the videos.

# Suggested Preparation

The modules are self-contained, but it will be helpful to have some experience with MATLAB and Simulink.   You can get that experience from:

MATLAB Onramp – a free two-hour introductory tutorial that teaches the essentials of MATLAB.

Simulink Onramp – a free three-hour introductory tutorial that teaches the essentials of Simulink.
